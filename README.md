minimvcf
========

An educational- and demo-purpose MVC mini-framework
---------------------------------------------------

- Creative Commons license
- PHP OOP, composer, bower, unit tests
- PHP 5.6+
- PSR2 and PSR7
- MVC structure and several other programming patterns demo
- Very basic router, no dispatcher, no dependency injections, no event manager (all possible to be added)
- Routing configuration only for internal purposes
- No database
- FirePHP used for debugging
- The high load capable site, caching-ready (close to be implemented)
- OOP design minimalistic greedy approach
- Clone to install

    *   $ git clone https://github.com/alecksmart/minimvcf.git
    *   $ composer install
    *   $ bower install

- Fully workable but obviously not good for production
- Written during 2 evening of spare time
- Seriously, use XXX framework instead

TODO
----

- PHPUnit demo
- karma/protractor demo
